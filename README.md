# CHIP-8 IDE

> [!WARNING]
> This tool was created for a class I was teaching that had a major scope reduction and became an altogether different thing. As a result, some intended features are unimplemented.
> - Code editing is unimplemented.
> - The CHIP-8 emulator works reasonably well, but only targets the original COSMAC VIP interpreter (as intended for the class).
> - There's a basic single-stepping debugger.
> - There's a naÃ¯ve "disassembler" that annotates each instruction with human-readable mnemonics.
>
> If you want a real CHIP-8 IDE, check out [Octo](https://johnearnest.github.io/Octo/). If you just want a fun project to hack on, knock yourself out!
